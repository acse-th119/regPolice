 Help on registration on the Police London
 
## requirements:
### First
 You need to install selenium 
 `pip install selenium`
 And download the driver file (I provided windows version here)
 Substitute the file path in the .py file

### Second
 You need to create a file called `mail_keyword.json`
 whats inside should be like a python dict.
 ```{"mail_host": "smtp.qq.com", "mail_user": "your qq number ", "mail_pass": "the password generated(search how to use smtp qq on baidu)", "sender": "your qq number @qq.com", "receivers": ["mail1@qq.com", "mail2@qq.com","mail3@qq.com"]}```
 
 
 that should work now.
